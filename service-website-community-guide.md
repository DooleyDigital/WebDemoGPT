## 🧩 SECTION 1 — Lessons from Reddit & Web-Design Communities (2020 – 2025)

### 🔹 1. Structure and Page Layout

> “Each service deserves its own page — each city or location, too.” – r/SEO
> “Your homepage should sell trust and clarity, not a list of everything.” – r/web_design

**Recommended Layout:**

```markdown
1. Homepage — Clear overview: what you do, who you help, where you serve.
2. Service Pages — One per service, each with benefits, visuals, and FAQs.
3. About Page — Establish trust, credentials, and mission.
4. Testimonials or Results — Proof via reviews and before/after photos.
5. Contact Page — Simple form and visible phone number (top and bottom).
6. Area Pages (optional) — Unique content per location with local references.
```

**Why:** Each page targets a specific intent and keyword for better indexing.

### 🔹 2. Copywriting and Messaging

> “Clear beats clever. People scan — they don’t read.” – r/marketing
> “Write how your customers talk, not how you want to sound.” – r/smallbusiness

**Guidelines:**

```markdown
- Avoid jargon; use the language customers use in reviews or Reddit posts.
- Keep sentences short (12–15 words).
- Use bullet points and 2–3 sentence paragraphs.
- End each section with a simple, visible CTA (e.g., “Get a Quote”).
```

### 🔹 3. Local & SEO Practices

> “Local SEO still rules for service businesses.” – r/localseo
> “Don’t keyword-stuff city names. Use natural phrasing.” – r/SEO

**Checklist:**

- Add schema markup (`LocalBusiness`, `Service`, `FAQ`).
